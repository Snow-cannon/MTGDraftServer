# MTG Draft Server

This is a full-stack project that allows any number of users to participate in a Magic The Gathering online draft. You can input a cube list and it will automatically parse and load in the card information and send each user their own packs to draft, passing them around. Once the draft is up users can then create a deck from their card set and play against one another.

Any number of game lobbies are usable, and people can join any game lobby by inputting the room code.
